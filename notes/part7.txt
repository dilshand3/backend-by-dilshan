Step 1 => 
         Now we will use multer, downlaoad the multer package
         npm i multer 
         And make a file multer.middlewares.js in middlewares

Step 2 =>Multer are use to save the file for some time. file will store in the diskStorage
        
        Now import the multer and now we will make variable storage 
        In this variable we will use diskStorage so we will use multer.diskStorage({In this we will write our query like destination, filename})
        In the destination we will make a function that take req,res,cb as arguement and this function save the file what destination we gave it like ./public./temp 
        In the filename we will make a function that req,file,cb as arguement and this function will write make the name of file we also can use original name using file.originalname
        At the end we will export it As u can see 
         
         this how everything will works

       import multer from "multer";

       const storage = multer.diskStorage({
       destination : function (req,res,cb) {
        cb(null,"./public/temp")
    },
       filename : function (req,file,cb){
        cb(null, file.originalname)
     }
})

export const upload = multer({storage,})
