Step 1 => 
        To upload into the files into the  cloudnery we will have to setup cloudnery in our environment we will use the command
        npm i cloudinary //Now the cloudinary is install

Step 2 => Now we will make a  file in utils name of cloudinary.js 

         Here we will import the v2 from cloudinary like this and name it 
         import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

       Now we will import the fs from "fs" this is comes by default with node.js so we don't need to downlaoad this seprately this is uses for making read , writing , permission , etc the files
       import it like this
       import fs from "fs"

        cloudinary.config({ //This config is copied from the cloudinary
        cloud_name: 'druh49ljx', 
        api_key: '593244433917352', 
        api_secret: '5KQjLrj3JDdRma-Z7c22KkIiVh4'
    });

Step 3 => 
        Now make 3 variable in the .env file CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET and write the value in it write the variable in the cloudinary.js file like this

        import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
        import fs from "fs"

        cloudinary.config({ 
                cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, 
                api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, 
                api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
              });

Note this is the configeration of cloudinary it will allow us to share files

Step 4 =>
        Now we will make a function for uploading the files in cloudinary and this take arguement of localFilePath and this function will be a async await function and export it 
        const uploadCloudnery = async (localFilePath ){}
        export {uploadOnClodinary}
        
        For error handling we will use try catch in this function cause if the files upload has failed how we will show the error 

       this how we will write this =>

        const uploadOnClodinary = async (localFilePath) => {
    try {
        if (!localFilePath) return null
        const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(localFilePath, {m 
            resource_type: "auto"  //resource_type auto mean every type of file
        })
        console.log("file is uploaded on cloudnery ", response.url);//response.url mean file URL
        return response;
    } catch (error) {
        fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath) //remove the locally saved files that failed to upload and unlink is method to delete the file and sync is method to work it as syncronous 
        return null
    }
}

       export {uploadOnClodinary} //export it so that we can use any other file
