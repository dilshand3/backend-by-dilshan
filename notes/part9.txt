Step 1 => 
         make a file user.controllers.js in controllers folder where we write the logic of regeistering of user 

Step 2 => 
         Here we will import asyncHandler that we write asyncHandler.js file in utils
         make a function registerUser and in it asyncHandler and in this asyncHandler we will we make new function 
         that send json with ok message and also export it 
 
 write like this =>
 import { asyncHandler } from "../utils/asyncHandler.js";

const regesiterUser = asyncHandler(async (req,res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        message : "ok"
    })
})
export {regesiterUser}

Step 3 => 
         Now make a user.routes.js in routes folder there we will manage url routes for regeistering user
        and import here router in it and make a variable of it export in it

        import { Router } from "express";
        const router = Router()

        export default router 

Step 4 => 
        Now in the app.js file we will import the routes before export of app
        like this and also declare are routes
        import userRoutes from "./routes/user.routes.js"
        app.use("/api/v1/users",userRouter)

app.use is middlewares it will send use register 

Step 5 =>
        Now user.routes.js write this 
        router.route("/register").post(regesiterUser)
