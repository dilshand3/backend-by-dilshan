                                          HTTP CRASH COURSE

what are the http header => 
                          meta data that comes with file are called http header. These data are key value pair .
                          We will get the header in both request and response

http uses => authentication, caching , manage state


request header => 
                 The data comes from client is called request header 

server header =>
                 The data comes from server is called server header

repersentation header => 
                        if the data is commepressed or encoding it would be called repersentation header

payload header => 
                 data (its not big)


Most common header =>
 (a) accept = application/json (it only accept the json data)                 
 (b) user = agent (sometimes we visiting an website and  website give us "use our app " message it commes from agent)
 (c) Authoraigation = jwt token
 (d) content-type = image or video or any other data
 (e) cookie = these are basically key value pair
 (f) cache = controlls (when to delete the data)


 most important => **
 
 http methods => basic set of operation that can be used to interact with server

 (1) get = if we want to take any resource we will use the get request 
 (2) head = it will only send the header not the message body
 (3) option = what are the operation availble in any end point
 (4) trace = loopback test (get some data)
 (5) delete = it will remove the resource
 (6) put = it will replace the resource
 (7) patch = it will replace or edit a perticuler part of resource
 (8) post = it will interact with resource (mostly add in resource)
