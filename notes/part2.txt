connection => 
          We can connect mongodb in 2 diffrent type, first is making a diffrent file for mongodb connection and import it main index.js file
          And second is connect it on main index.js file

Step 1 => 
        Make a file  db/index.js

Step 2 =>        
        make PORT variable in .env file and make MONGODB_URI variable for mongodb connection string

Step 3 => 
        make database name in constants.js file and export it like this
        "export const DB_NAME = "namehere""

Step 4 => 
      db/index.js :
                  import mongoose from "mongoose"
                  import { DB_NAME } from "../constants.js";

                  const connectDB = async () => {
                  try {
                      const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`)
                      console.log(`mongoDB is connected succesfully  !!! db host : ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`);
                } catch (error) {
                      console.log("mongoDB connected failed due to",error)
                      process.exit(1)
                }
            }
                 export default connectDB


(1) => first we will import mongoose and DB_NAME from mongoose and constants.js file
(2) => second we will make a function that will connect us to mongoDB and this will a async await function 
(3) => For error handling we will write here try & catch function (As u can see how to write)
(4) => After making function we will export it using export (As u can see that)

Step 5 => 
      src/index.js (main index.js file)

       import dotenv from "dotenv"
       import connectDB from "./db/index.js"
       dotenv.config({
       path:'./env'
       })

       connectDB()

(1) => first we will import dotenv 
(2) => second we will import connectDB function that we made last time
(3) => Now we will confige the dotenv (As u can see it)
(4) => Now cal connectDB function
